# Reverse Proxy Security Interview
Our previous reverse proxy that we built was insecure and built in PHP!

We want to build our reverse proxy with the latest technology so that
we can attract the best talent!

# Assignment
### Old Proxy.
 - What security issues does the old proxy have?
 - How does a reverse proxy work?
 - What are some security gotchas of this?

### New Proxy
The expectation is not that all of these are completed. If there is one of these that you really love, I would also love to see a GREAT WAF, or a GREAT IP firewall, instead of hacky ones.

 - Build a new reverse proxy.
 - Support Basic Authentication.
 - ~Add a "WAF" that blocks requests that contain "<script>" or "&ltimg&gt"~
 - ~Block IP addresses from 8.8.8.8 ~
